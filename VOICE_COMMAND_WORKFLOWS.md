## Tips for Efficient Voice Control

### 1. **Use Specific Commands**
✅ Good: "scan surroundings", "detect obstacles", "add relative"
❌ Bad: "scan", "what's around me", "new person"

### 2. **Speak Clearly**
✅ Good: Enunciate each word distinctly
❌ Bad: Mumbling or running words together

### 3. **Command Quickly**
✅ Good: Say command soon after hotword detection
❌ Bad: Long pause between hotword and command

### 4. **Use Natural Pacing**
✅ Good: Speak at conversational speed
❌ Bad: Too fast or too slow

### 5. **Chain Related Commands**
✅ Good: "show alerts" → "battery status" → "home"
❌ Bad: Say hotword between each command
